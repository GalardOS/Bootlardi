# Bootlardi
Bootlardi is a component of the GalardOS operating system that is in charge of loading the kernel and taking some information about the system the kernel is going to run on. Apart from that basic functionality, bootlardi is able to read a configuration file on the boot partition that indicates what ramfs image to load for the main system and rescue mode.
